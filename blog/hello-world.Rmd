Setup a webpage with [rstudio/blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and host it on github.

As I want to set up a personal page rather than one for a project, I want to host it at `<username>.github.io`. Following the instructions found in the second part of [this](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) post. 

https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa

1. On github create repo called `<your-username>-hugo`
2. On github create repo called `<your-username>.github.io`
3. In Rstudio open a new project and choose clone git repo and choose the `<your-username>-hugo` repo
4. Create your site using `blogdown::new_site()`
5. In the config.toml change `baseurl = "https://<your-username>.github.io/"`
